##Playing the Game
Gameplay is handled much like a role-playing game. There is an order and structure to play tied to the changing of each month, but it is interwoven with narration and in character portrayals. Each month works like this:

1. The player with the most Influence in their current hand flips over the Event card from the event deck. The event is resolved before anything else.
2. Players enter Taxation, collecting Resources, Piety and Influence as dicated by the territory and vassals they control. They also pay for the upkeep of any of their Units at this time.
3. The player who flipped over the Event card begins to narrate events in play, taking actions, using Influence cards and so forth. This player can continue as long as they like until another player at the table speaks the words, "In the meantime..." and then takes over narration and begins taking actions. This cycle continues until all the players have done everything they wanted to do for the month. Once it is agreeded upon that everyone is done, a new month begins.

Game play is very loose and meant to be very free form. Players may move their units, engage in battle, play Influence cards, and take actions. They may not, however, communicate to each other outside ofThere are several actions a player can take that are not dictated by the cards:

- **Send an Envoy:** By spending a Piety, a character may send a neutral Church Envoy to another character in play. If the character in question is controlled by a player, the Envoy functions as a neutral mouthpiece to pass communications. If the character in question is a vassal, the player who holds that character's loyalty designates another player at the table to portray this character and allows the initiating character the oportunity to put the target's loyalty in question. This creates a scene between two players that cannot be interupted by other players.
- **Question Loyalty:** A character in a scene may attempt to put the loyalty of another character's vassal into question. A plyer may discard an Influnce card to make a roll. For every Influence discarded, the character may roll another 1D6. On a roll equal to or less than your character's Influence score minus 1, the character's loyalty is put into question. Until the liege of this character discards Influence cards equal to the character's total Taxation benefit, the character provides no benifit to their lord and their Units remain neutral in any conflict.
- **Visit Another Court:** By moving your character's Unit into the same territory of another character whom you are not at war with, a scene can be initiated between these players that cannot be interupted by other players. This is one of two times characters can Forge Alliances, with the other being during a conclave being called.
- **Trade:** If colonies are connected via roads, two characters may trade anything they control with one another. If there are no roads, you may spend a Resource to send a trade caravan to another character's territory.
- **Marshal Units:** At any time you may marshal Units. They begin in the location in which they are marshalled and cannot move until the next month.
- **Disband Units:** Following Taxation you may disband any unit. The unit cannot be recalled until the next month.
- **Technology Investment:** A player may spend 5 Resources per die to make a technology roll. For every 5 Resources spent, the character may roll 1D6. On a roll of 6 the character may select a Technology that has now spread throughout their territory.
- **Declare War:** By spending a Resource, a character may send a herald to another player's character and Declare War. When doing so flip over the appropriate War Card. War continues until either a Peace of God is called or the two players agree to a treaty, putting them at peace for as many months as they were at war.
- **Forge Alliance:** If characters are in the same location, they may Forge an Alliance. Forging an Alliance is done through a marriage contract between the two houses. It allows their Units to work together in battles and sieges, ignore the cost of trade if there are no roads present, and allows an ally to enter a war on the side of their ally without formaly declaring war.
- **Breaking the Peace:** If a character Declares War on an Ally, while under an edict of peace from a previous war or breaking the Peace of God that character incurs a Debt to their target. This Debt cannot be called due while the two sides are at war. Breaking the Peace of God also incurs a Debt to the Arzbispo if that title is currently in play.
- **Debt is Due:** A character may spend a Resource to send a herald to another character to call due a Debt or demand if the character is there in person. The character then gets to pick an Influence Card from the hand of the debtor or demand 3 Resources.

##The Characters
The game has five characters and requires at least three players to work.

###Ottokar Zupplang
**Influence (5) Resources (3) Piety (1)**

Over a hundred years ago my family ruled the Tarathan Empire as rightful heirs to the Ziring. Now is my chance to regain that glory as the Patriarchâ€™s appointed leader of this Great Northern Undertaking. I will bind my house to that of Von Hova, create a new eden here, and crush the pretenders to the Tarathan throne.

1. May spend resources to recruit an additional Tarathan Knight Unit once per Season from the Empire.
2. Once per Season he may grant an old Imperial Title to another character. If the character accepts, they gain 2 Influence Cards and owe Ottokar a Debt. If the character declines they must discard 2 Influence cards.
3. Once per Season he may spend Resources to purchase the services of a Mercenary Company already in play. The cost is equal to the Mercanery Company's Cost plus 1.

####Victory Conditions
Ottokar must meet the following conditions to bring the game to a conclusion in his favor:

1. Conquer or Allied with Richeza Von Hova
2. 3 Tarathan Nobles as Vassals
3. 2 Tarathan Osbispos as Vassals
4. 11 Villages or Towns as Vassals

###Richeza Von Hova
**Influence (6) Resources (2) Piety (3)**

I am the daughter of a proud house, widow of the true Tarathan Emperor, and I will not be denied my due. This crusade is a means to an end. I will crush the fools who think a woman cannot rule like, Karlin and de Rodirna. I will carve out of this forbidding a country a place worthy of my young son.

1. May spend Resources to recruit an additional Tarathan Knight Unit once per Season from the Empire.
2. Every Season she may propose a betrothal between herself and another character. Doing so establishes a Peace of God between the two characters, even if they were at war. After that Season ends, the betrothal is recinded (of course) and a new Declaration of War is required to restart military actions.
3. Once per Season she may show favor to another character's vassal by Discarding one Influence Card. This places that character's loyalty into question.

####Victory Conditions
Richeza must meet the following conditions to bring the game to a conclusion in his favor:

1. 6 Osbispos as Vassals
2. 7 Nobles as Vassals
3. 3 Towns as Vassals

###Henryk Von Karllin
**Influence (4) Resources (2) Piety (5)**

Even though my father died in disgrace in the first attempt to pacify this awful place, the Tarathan Emperor trusts me to return glory to the order. I will forge a holy fief of the Empire, binding the others on the yoke to my will. Even the Arzobispo will have to recognize my authority. I know i am chosen by god.

1. May spend Resources to recruit an additional Cup Knight Unit once per Season from the Empire.
2. When his Unit is in the Village or Town of another player which has available Conscript Units, he may recruit that Unit. The Unit remains his to control until either he disbands it or it is destroyed.
3. If a Conscript Unit he controls spends a Season in a territory he controls that has a training ground, it upgrades to a Cup Knight Infantry Unit.

####Victory Conditions
Henryk must meet the following conditions to bring the game to a conclusion in his favor:

1. Holds the Title Grandmaster of the Order
2. 6 Osbispos as Vassals
3. 12 Towns as Vassals

###Kasimir Azarowski
**Influence (5) Resources (4) Piety (2)**

I have long accepted that my brother is the heir to the throne of Oldaska, my sister will be a queen and my other brothers will hold the great duchies. Even so, do I not deserve greatness in my own right? This undertaking is my chance to shine. I will bring the one true god to this place, eliminating the threat of Tarathans on Oldaskaâ€™s northern border and carving out my own duchy.

1. May spend Resources to recruit an additional Oldaskan Knight Unit once per Season from Oldaska.
2. Once per Season he may discard Influence Cards equal to the cost of a Sarl Unit to make it his Unit. His Unit must be in the same territory as the Sarl Unit to do this.
3. If he razes a non Oldaskan Village he can immediately play an Oldaskan Colonist card from his hand to this territory. In doing so he does not need to draw from the Colony deck.

####Victory Conditions
Kasimir must meet the following conditions to bring the game to a conclusion in his favor:

1. Holds the Duke of Sarl Country Title
2. All Oldaskan Osbispos as Vassals
3. All Oldaskan and Sarl Nobles
4. 8 Towns or Villages

**Influence (4) Resources (4) Piety (6)**

Exile. Frozen exile because I dared suggest I might be worthy of the holy see. Damn them. Damn them all. Oh I will bring the true god to these heathens. I will do my duty. I will also burn everyone and everything that gets in the way of my completing this great undertaking and returning to the south where it is warm and there is an actual civilization.

1. Using Vorish Colonists to establish Villages is free for Martin.
2. Once per Season he may invoke the Peace of God, bringing all ongoing wars to a halt as if they had been ended by treaty.
3. When a Church Edict is drawn from the Events Deck, he may choose to have it reshuffled back into the deck forcing a redraw.

####Victory Conditions
